Mrs Eaves LigatureMakerªÊThis application automates the process of replacing specified letter combinations with ligatures in selected text. (Requires the Mrs Eaves Smart Ligature fonts.)Ê________________________________________________________________Installation:1. Install the Mrs Eaves Smart Ligature fonts as you normally install fonts. (For more information, consult the font installation instructions.)2. Install the Mrs Eaves LigatureMaker application by dragging its icon to your hard disk.There are two ways of converting text with LigatureMaker. The "Convert Clipboard"  method is useful for interactive usage in conjunction with a page layout or text editing application; the "Convert File" method may be advantageous for large text files.________________________________________________________________Convert Clipboard Method:Start up Mrs Eaves LigatureMaker by double clicking on the icon.(Upon initial startup, you will be asked for your registration number.)A window with the "Convert Clipboard" button will appear; you will use this button to convert text that you copy from a document. The "Convert Clipboard" command can also be accessed from the "Convert" menu,  by typing the "command K" shortcut or by pressing the "return" or "enter" keys.ÊNext, you will need to start up a page layout or text editing application with which to create your document.1. Type or import some text.2. Select the text and change the font to Mrs Eaves Smart Lig Roman, Italic or Bold.3. Copy the selected text and leave it selected.4. Go to the Mrs Eaves LigatureMaker application and click the "Convert Clipboard" button.5. Go back to the main application and paste, replacing the selected text. The converted text should now contain the selected ligaturesÊ________________________________________________________________Preferences Dialog Box: ÊSince not all ligatures may be appropriate for all occasions, LigatureMaker allows you to selectively de-activate ligatures one by one.The "Preferences" dialog box under the "Convert" menu displays a list of all available ligatures; only the selected ones will be replaced in your selected text. The "Preferences" dialog box can also be accessed by typing the "command P" shortcut.A few letter combinations have alternate ligatures; there are two different ligature designs for each the "ae", "oe" and "ss" combinations. You can control which, if any, are used in the "Preferences" dialog box by deselecting those ligature designs that you do not with to use."Convert Clipboard Back" Command:LigatureMaker can also convert text back to your original text, so that it will display correctly in standard fonts. 1. Select the text and change the font to a standard font, such as Mrs Eaves Roman or any system text font.2. Copy the selected text and leave it selected.3. Go to the Mrs Eaves LigatureMaker application and select the "Convert Clipboard Back" command from the "Convert" menu. The "Convert Clipboard Back" can also be activated by typing the "command B" shortcut or by pressing the "option return" or "option enter" keys.4. Go back to the main application and paste, replacing the selected text.________________________________________________________________Convert File Method:1. Make sure the file to be converted is in text only format.2. Start up Mrs Eaves LigatureMaker by double clicking on the icon.3. Check the "Preferences" dialog box to verify the settings.4. Select "Convert File"  from the "File" menu.5. A dialog box will appear asking you for the location of the file to be converted. Navigate to the file and select it.6. Under "Save converted file as:" type the desired name of the converted file and select "Save."When you open the text file, you may notice that the converted text, as it appears in the default font, contains some unusual characters. This is because the default font does not include the special ligatures necessary to make sense of the converted text. The ligatures will appear when the text is set in one of the Mrs Eaves Smart Ligatures fonts.To convert a file back to your original text, follow the preceding 6 steps, except in step 4 instead select "Convert File Back"  command from the "File" menu.Files can also be converted with the drag and drop method.1. Make sure the file to be converted is in text only format.2. In LigatureMaker, check the "Preferences" dialog box to verify the settings.3. In the Finder, drag and drop the text file over the Mrs Eaves LigatureMaker icon.4. LigatureMaker will convert the text and save a copy of the file following the original file name by a bullet. (The "Convert File Back" command is not available through drag & drop; use the file menu command instead.)________________________________________________________________Things to be Aware of:Spell Checker:Spell check text before converting it. Spell checkers will not work properly on text after it has been converted with LigatureMaker.All Caps:To use the capital ligatures, the original text must be typed in all caps. Changing the text from lower case to caps through a style setting in the page layout or text editing application usually does not work because the basic characters usually retain their lower case key identities and will therefore not be converted properly with LigatureMaker.First Come, First Serve:Ligatures are replaced on a first come, first serve basis. For example, the word ENTROPY contains two ligature combinations, NT and TR, which overlap at the "T" character. If the entire word is selected and all ligature combinations are selected in the "Preferences" dialog box, LigatureMaker will implement the NT ligature; the TR ligature will not be used. To override this, deselect the NT ligature in the "Preferences" dialog box, or convert only a portion of text with LigatureMaker, starting with the "TR" characters.Foreign & Math Characters:In order to make room for the ligatures, the Mrs Eaves Smart Ligatures fonts do not contain accents, foreign or math characters. For proper conversion, remove these characters from the original text before converting with LigatureMaker. Accents, foreign or math characters can be added back in afterwards and set in the Mrs Eaves regular fonts.For proper performance, your original text must not include the following characters:ÊThese characters will not display properly in the Smart Ligature fonts. To use these characters, they need to be displayed in a standard font, such as Mrs Eaves Roman.Style and Font Formatting:When text is copied and converted, any style or mixed font formatting is lost. Therefore, it is best to add complicated formatting after running the text conversion.To convert a file that is already formatted, copy and convert sections by font styles piece by piece, or change all text to the predominant font; then go back in afterwards to implement the less common font style uses.Font Selection:Remember that converted text will not display correctly if it is not set in one of the Mrs Eaves Smart Ligatures fonts.The Good News:Once text is converted with LigatureMaker, the font can be changed among the three Mrs Eaves Smart Ligatures fonts, Roman, Italic or Bold, since all three of these contain the same ligature combinations.________________________________________________________________Copyright © 1996, Emigre, Inc.LigatureMaker application Copyright © 1996, Just van Rossum, Letterror.
